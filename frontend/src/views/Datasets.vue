The 31 categories in the dataset consist of objects commonly encountered in office settings, such as keyboards, file cabinets, and laptops. The Amazon domain contains on average 90 images per class and 2817 images in total. As these images were captured from a website of online merchants, they are captured against clean background and at a unified scale. The DSLR domain contains 498 low-noise high resolution images (4288×2848). There are 5 objects per category. Each object was captured from different viewpoints on average 3 times. For Webcam, the 795 images of low resolution (640×480) exhibit significant noise and color as well as white balance artifacts.'},

The four domains are: Art – artistic images in the form of sketches, paintings, ornamentation, etc.; Clipart – collection of clipart images; Product – images of objects without a background and Real-World – images of objects captured with a regular camera. It contains 15,500 images, with an average of around 70 images per class and a maximum of 99 images in a class.'},
